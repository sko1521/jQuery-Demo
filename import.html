                <p>The click event occurs when an element is clicked.
                        
                        The click() method triggers the click event, or attaches a function to run when a click event occurs.</p>

<div id="ready" class="event-info">
        <p>The ready() method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes safe to manipulate. This will often be a good time to perform tasks that are needed before the user views or interacts with the page, for example to add event handlers and initialize plugins. When multiple functions are
        added via successive calls to this method, they run when the DOM is ready in the order in which they are added. </p>

        <p>The blur event occurs when an element loses focus.The blur() method triggers the blur event, or attaches a function to run when a blur event occurs. <br>
                The focus event occurs when an element gets focus (when selected by a mouse click or by "tab-navigating" to it).
                
                The focus() method triggers the focus event, or attaches a function to run when a focus event occurs.</p>

<div id="on">
        <p>The on() method attaches one or more event handlers for the selected elements and child elements.

       <p>Tip: To remove event handlers, use the off() method.</p>                  
       <p>Tip: To attach an event that only runs once and then removes itself, use the one() method.</p>

<div id="off">
                <p>The off() method is most often used to remove event handlers attached with the on() method.</p>               
               <p> As of jQuery version 1.7, the off() method is the new replacement for the unbind(), die() and undelegate() methods.</p> 
                
               <p>Note: To remove specific event handlers, the selector string must match the one passed to the on() method, when the event handler was attached. </p> 
                
              <p>Tip: To attach an event that only runs once and then removes itself, use the one() method.</p>  
</div>
<div id="one">
        <p>The one() method attaches one or more event handlers for the selected elements, and specifies a function to run when the event occurs.    
        When using the one() method, the event handler function is only run ONCE for each element.</p> 
        <p> Click event will execute only for once for element</p>
